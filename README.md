RADO-SCS model is the first open source spinal cord model for simulating conventional/High Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation, Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) Stimulation, and transpinal Direct Current Stimulation (tsDCS). The RADO-SCS model emerged over years. In our very first version of the SCS model, RADO-SCS 1.0, cylindrical shapes were used to represent the spinal tissues which later got upgraded with an extensive research and modeling works to RADO-SCS 2.0. This version included detailed spinal tissues anatomy but the spinal roots, rootlets, sympathetic chain, DRG, and  vasculatures were not included in that model. 

Freely available online, the RADO-SCS will be updated continuously with version control.

# Significance of the RADO-SCS model
The RADO-SCS 3.0 can be used to simulate any SCS approach with both unprecedented resolution (precision) and transparency (reproducibility). Compared to prior models, RADO-SCS model meets or exceeds detail for every tissue compartment. The resulting electric fields in white and gray-matter, and axon model activation thresholds are broadly consistent with prior simulations.

# Getting Started
Before you download the RADO-SCS model for simulation, we suggest to read “forward modeling workflow for current flow models” which will provide detailed help with a general FEM modeling Pipeline using CAD-derived/MRI-derived models. The current flow modeling pipelines have been published many times in our prior publications (https://doi.org/10.1101/704940). When ready, you can download the latest version of the RADO-SCS model ( V 3.0) and use it for your exploratory clinical or academic research. 

# Modeling Workflow
1. Download all STL files as they represent realistic and anatomically detailed T9-T11 level spinal tissues, vertebraes, IV discs, soft-tissues, vasculatures, and clinical leads (pre-positioned). If you don’t need all the detailed tissues, you can remove them from your final model. 

2. If you want to position the SCS leads in different location, import all STLs using CAD software like SolidWorks 2016 or later  (recommended),   Abacus, Mimics, etc., and re-position the leads.

3. Save your final model files and import them either in free or commercial meshing software. We recommend Simpleware or other powerful meshing   software because the model has sub-millimeter resolution.

4. After the model is meshed, import the model into finite element method (FEM) or finite element analysis (FEA) current flow simulating   software such as COMSOL, Abaqus, Mimics, etc. 

5. If interested in  fiber activation thresholds simulation, export the extracellular voltages calculated from the FEM model and couple it into   the NEURON/ Matlab modeling platform.

# Notes and Disclaimers

1. Version 3.0 is the most updated version of the RADO-SCS model.

2. RADO-SCS does not include a pathological human spinal cord, but there are plans to incorporate this in future versions. 

3. This open-source model only includes CAD derived model files with pre-positioned SCS leads. However, the users can change the lead position using commercial or open-source CAD-software as their need.

4. RADO-SCS is not a modeling open-source software. It is a CAD-derived model of realistic human spinal anatomy which can be downloaded and simulated for educational, clinical, or exploratory purposes. See the modeling pipeline on how to use the open-source RADO-SCS for numerical   simulation. 

5. There is a plan to develop an open-source current flow modeling platform using the most-updated version of the RADO-SCS model in future.
